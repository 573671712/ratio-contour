    RRC (VERSION 1.0): A SALIENT BOUNDARY DETECTION TOOL BY
           COMBINING BOUNDARY AND REGION INFORMATION

This software package is developed for detecting salient closed
boundaries from an image. The main codes were implemented
in C++ using gcc-4.1 in Linux. It also needs the recent Matlab
Software (with Image Processing Toolbox) to perform some image 
preprocessing and result display. This work is covered by Copyright 
(c) University of South Carolina. It incorporates Blossom4 code
for graph matching that is developed by W. Cook and A. Rohe. The 
technical details of this package can be found in the enclosed 
file "document.pdf".

Update: 06/24/2006


                             INSTALL

After unpacking the package, in the RRC folder, run
     ./install
This will create an executable RRC.


                              USAGE
   (1) Go to the folder "matlab", in the Matlab environment, run
           preprocess('path/foo')
to preprocess the image "foo.pgm" and write the output to "path/foo.lines".

   (2) From this installation folder, from the shell, run  
          ./RRC path/foo [-n #]
to extract the salient boundaries. "n" is the number of boundaries to be
extracted. The default value is 1.

   (3) Go to the folder "matlab", in the Matlab environment, run
            displayResults('path/foo', n)
to display the n detected boundaries, which are also saved as EPS and PNG
images in the folder "path/". 

A set of test images used in the enclosed "document.pdf" are provided in 
the folder "images".
