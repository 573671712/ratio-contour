Ratio Contour implementation (ver 0.1)
--------------------------------------------0
By Song Wang and Joachim S. Stahl

This program is tested in Red Hat Linux 3.2.2-5. It should work in other 
Linux enviroment with the same or newer version of kernel. The techniques 
are documented in our paper "Salient Closed Boundary Extraction with 
Ratio Contour", which is included in this package as pami05.pdf.

Install:
-------
Uncompress the package by

> tar zxf rc-install.tgz

To install simply type

> ./install



Usage:
-----
After installation go to the newly created folder

> cd ~/ratiocontour

Set the environment variables by running one of the following commands,
depending on your shell:

> source setBASH
for bash shell

> source setCSH
for csh shell

This setting works for the current sessions and needs to be called
every time a new session is started in order to use ratiocontour.
(If you want to make these setting permanent it is possible to
modify ~/.bashrc or ~/.cshrc for this purpose).

To process an image located in /path/foo.pgm go to the folder 
~/ratiocontour/code/ and run

> ./Rcontour /path/foo.pgm

When the program is finished processing the image, it will output the top 5
results in the form of
/path/foo-RC-#.jpg
and
/path/foo-RC-#.eps
where # is a number from 1 to 5.

If you have Matlab software installed, you can also run the program in Matlab.
In the matlab environment, go to '~ratiocontour/code' and process an image by 

Rcontour '/path/foo.pgm'
